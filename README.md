# GAN-FID-fashion-MNIST
Attached is a nice GAN to create images that look like they were taken from the MNIST FASION image set.
Since the discriminator also improves during training, I needed an external tool to evaluate the improvement of the genreted images.
To do this I used FID.
In addition, I have attached pictures to illustrate the training progress from epoch#0 to epoch#20.
Thanks for reading,
